# Issue with custom openApiGenerate Task

Run `gradle clean build` and you will get:

```shell
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
A problem was found with the configuration of task ':web:openApiGenerate-custom' (type 'GenerateTask').
  - Gradle detected a problem with the following location: 'C:\Users\user.name\github-projects\gradle-plugins-issues-1193\web\build\generated\openapi'.
    
    Reason: Task ':web:generateEffectiveLombokConfig' uses this output of task ':web:openApiGenerate-custom' without declaring an explicit or implicit dependency. This can lead to incorrect results being produced, depending on what order the tasks are executed.
    
    Possible solutions:
      1. Declare task ':web:openApiGenerate-custom' as an input of ':web:generateEffectiveLombokConfig'.
      2. Declare an explicit dependency on ':web:openApiGenerate-custom' from ':web:generateEffectiveLombokConfig' using Task#dependsOn.
      3. Declare an explicit dependency on ':web:openApiGenerate-custom' from ':web:generateEffectiveLombokConfig' using Task#mustRunAfter.
